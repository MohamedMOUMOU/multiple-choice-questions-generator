"The biggest thorn in the paw of my grand plan to stop going to school was that my mom would probably notice that I wasn't going to school. It wasn't an issue, however. When I got home my mom was running around the house shuttling clothes from closets and drawers to open suitcases. ""Are we going somewhere?"" I asked, setting my car keys on the kitchen table. She stopped in place and stood up, looking at me for a moment. ""I am,"" she started. ""I've been talking to Aunt Cathy on the phone and I don't think she's doing very well, with the divorce and then your father. I'm going to spend a few days out there with her until she's feeling better."" Cathy is my dad's sister and I always suspected her to be a bit batty. She didn't come from Delaware for my dad's, her brother's, funeral; said she wouldn't be able to drive herself, and nobody could pick her up. My mom continued, ""Would that be alright? I mean, will you be okay by yourself for a while?"" She must have noticed that I was handling things better than I had been at first. My dad died in January, it was now March. Seems like enough time to me. ""I'll be fine,"" I said. ""Nothing major going on, just school. Are you leaving tonight or tomorrow?"" Nothing major. She left early the next morning, before I would normally leave for school. Before she left she told me not to throw any wild teenage drug parties. I told her I wouldn't know how if I wanted to. She left, I went back to bed. It's a marvelous feeling, to sleep right through the start of the school day. Skipping school is one thing, playing sick is one thing, but just not going to school is another feeling entirely. It felt like freedom. The kind of freedom that will cost you later, but at the time seems worth it.

"Two a.m. and we are standing on the side of the road waiting for the fire service to take the top off the car in front of us. The wind whistles across the flats making us all shiver despite our fleeces and our jackets. Two cars have been involved in a high-speed road traffic accident (RTA), the parked car that was hit has been shunted forward leaving ten-yard-long skid marks. The cars aren't too damaged but the seats inside have shifted around, trapping the occupants. There are seven ambulances here, four fire trucks, half a dozen police and three ambulance officers with clipboards. There are eight patients, all but one need cutting from the cars and collaring and boarding. The only woman involved is 'walking wounded'. The reason that it is taking so long for our car to get its lid removed by the fire service is because of the position of one of the patients inside. He looks rather unwell and the crew looking after him really would like to get to him sooner rather than later. Our ambulance was fourth on scene. When I arrived I spoke to a stationmate to see what he wanted us to do, who he wanted us to look after. Normally he is the station clown, now he's all serious and professional, no fake beards or silly glasses. Everyone gets checked over, all the ambulance crews are calm, it's serious but it doesn't look like anyone is about to die; more a case of being careful moving the patients 'just in case'. The roof comes off the car and with the help of another crew and some firefighters we get our patient out safely and strapped to a board. He is freezing cold. He is not wearing warm clothing so the delay in getting him out and the terrible weather have us concerned for his body temperature. We are in a new ambulance so the heater works. Turning it up to full we are soon sweating as we assess the patient and prepare for transport.

"The staffing of ambulances at the moment is ... to put it bluntly ... poor. Working on the fast response unit (FRU - a car that is designed to get to the sickest patients quickly) means that I often get to an emergency call within minutes of it being made. Unfortunately, with so few ambulances on the road, the patient and I are often left staring at each other for long periods of time; in a couple of cases up to an hour. I was sent to a young man having an asthma attack. It was late at night, and he had been queuing to get into a nightclub when he had started to feel his breathing getting tight, the sign of an asthma attack, so had headed to a taxi office in order to go home. Unfortunatel, his asthma progressed and so an ambulance was called. What he got was me, on my own, in a car. After dealing with the drunken group of teenage girls that had taken time out of waiting for a cab to start loudly 'caring' for my patient, I started my assessment. It was a cold night so I sat the young man in the taxi office and listened to his chest. I could hear a nice loud wheezing from his lungs so I started him on the first dose of our asthma medication. I got his details and checked his vital signs, and waited for the ambulance to turn up. It takes between five and ten minutes for the asthma medication to finish, and by the end of it there was still no ambulance. I listened to his chest again, still an audible wheeze, so I gave him a second dose of the medication. So there he was, sitting in a cab office at three in the morning with a mask over his face, 'smoke' pouring from it, and all around us were intoxicated people getting cabs home. It was not very dignified.

"I think I'm going to be leaving my job soon. I went to a six-month-old baby with possible meningitis. The baby had the right sort of rash (although it was only on the back of the knee and, after checking, nowhere else). It had a temperature, but was one of the happiest, most alert children I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. It just didn't seem as if it had meningitis, and trust me, I've seen a fair few children and adults with it so I have a pretty good idea what it looks like. Then, as in the past, I was left waiting for an ambulance. For around 45 minutes. There was no way I was going to be able to transport the patient in my car. It's just not equipped to carry such a small child. We don't have baby seats and as the family didn't have a car they didn't have one either. So the family ended up phoning a friend to take them to the hospital. The ambulance turned up just as they were getting into their friend's car. All I had going through my head was the potential newspaper headline 'No Ambulance For Baby Dying Of Killer Bug!' Later that night I went to a woman who was having an extremely painful miscarriage. There is nothing I can do for that on scene, the patient needs to be in hospital. Thankfully the ambulance wasn't too far behind me, but if I had been waiting on scene then it would have been a very awkward and distressing wait (again, because of the pain, it would have been impossible to transport her in my car). More and more I'm looking at my watch as an ambulance fails to arrive. It's only a matter of time before I have someone die in front of me while waiting for an ambulance. So, I'm seriously considering leaving the FRU and going back to work on an ambulance. That way I can pick up sick people, and take them to where they need to be: a hospital.

"The call details appeared on the computer terminal in the FRU: 'Nineteen-year-old male - Patient has lump on ribs - difficulty in breathing.' Halfway to the address, a private house, my screen was updated: 'Patient has taken cocaine.' I was met at the front door by a young male, stripped to the waist and obviously agitated. 'Comein, myribsfeelfunny, andmyshoulderbladedon'tfeelright.' 'Slow down,' I said, taking his pulse - 110, a bit on the high side, but he was bouncing off the walls. 'My ribs man! They don't feel right! Have a feel.' He then started running his hands up and down his chest. 'Have you fallen over? Been hit? Anything unusual happened?' I asked. 'No man - just feel them ... FEEL THEM!' 'Look, you need to calm down,' I replied. 'I can't do anything while you are hopping all over the place.' He started shouting, 'FEEL THEM! JUST FUCKIN' FEEL THEM!' He turned his back to me, indicating that I should feel his normal-looking ribs. A sudden wave of anger passed over me - it was all I could do to not punch him in the back. I examined his ribs; they felt perfectly normal to me. 'There,' I said, 'your ribs are fine.' 'What about my shoulder blades man?' 'Look, you've taken cocaine right? You are feeling paranoid, it's normal, just try to relax a little.' 'WHAT ... ABOUT ... MY ... FUCKIN' ... SHOULDER BLADES!' He turned his back on me again. I gritted my teeth and grabbed his shoulder blades. 'They are fine. Now. Sit. Down.' He sat down. Then he stood up, then he paced around the kitchen, then he did a few circuits of the sofa, then he sat down again, then he stood up and hopped around a bit. I was getting tired just watching him. 'Look,' I said trying to calm him, and me, down, 'is this the first time you've taken cocaine?' 'No man!' 'OK, well if you want we can take you to the hospital, get you checked out if you'd like?' 'NO!' he shouted. 'I'm not going to hospital.'

"It was cold, it was dark and it was raining the sort of thin greasy rain that soaks straight through your clothes. I was making my way to one of the Docklands Light Railway stations for a 'Male - collapsed, caller not willing to approach patient.' I'd been to this station in the last week for a hoax call and I wasn't sure if this was a repeat performance. At the bottom of the stairs just sheltered from the rain was a young man in his twenties, dirty, dressed in filthy clothes and curled up next to a plastic bag. Standing over him was another man, this one dressed in a suit, looking a bit concerned. (The London borough of Tower Hamlets has both the richest, and the poorest population in London.) 'He's just laying there, not talking,' the smartly dressed man said. 'I didn't really know what to do ...' I let him know that I'd take care of the patient, and that he had done the right thing and could go home. It was just me and the patient. Given the way he looked it was a reasonable assumption that he was homeless. If he was homeless then there was a reasonable assumption that he was drunk and given that he was in such a public place there was a chance that there was something physically wrong with him. I attempted to wake him up - he was keeping his eyes closed when I tried to open them, so I knew that he wasn't really unconscious. 'Look mate,' I said, 'if you don't open your eyes, I'll have to check your blood sugar, which means poking a needle into your finger. If you open your eyes then I won't have to do that.' No response. So I checked his blood sugar along with the rest of his vital signs; everything was fine. I crouched down opposite him. 'Look, you can open your eyes and talk to me you know - we'll still take you to hospital. To be honest, I can't blame you, an A&E waiting room has got to be a pretty good option on a crappy night like this.'

"Seven-hour shifts are really easy to do, especially when you have spent the last year doing only twelve-hour shifts. The jobs tonight were pretty easy - even easier for me as I was driving the ambulance rather than treating the patients. We had a 16-year-old girl with a sore throat, a pair of drunks, one of whom had a twisted ankle, a little old lady who'd fallen over indoors and had a nasty scrape to her arm, and a young woman, twelve weeks pregnant, who had been assaulted at work and struck in the stomach. The real standout job for me shows just how daft some people are. The patient was a twelve-year-old boy. We got the job as 'child banging head on walls and floor' and when we turned up the child was indeed clutching his head and hitting it against a wall. The parents and child spoke poor English, but we easily managed to learn that the child was suffering from an earache, and that this was the cause of the head-hitting. 'How long has he had the pain?' asked my crewmate for the night. 'Five years then, three hours now,' replied the father. We understood what he meant - the child had an earache five years ago, but this current episode, and the reason why we were called out, had lasted three hours. 'Have you given him any painkillers?' 'No,' the father looked confused. 'Do you have any painkillers?' my crewmate asked. 'Yes, but we haven't given him any,' said the father. So the family could see their child rolling around the floor, screaming in pain and banging his head against the walls, and didn't consider that a painkiller might have - oh, I don't know - helped with the pain. I can imagine the scene in the hospital when the nurses give the child some pain relief - the parents looking at each other, slapping their foreheads and saying, 'Doh! We could have done that!' There are a lot of daft people out there - and I get to meet most of them.

"On the Monday before that Friday the 13th, I was at the Pick-a-Chick. That's what the sign said outside, although it wasn't really a Pick-a-Chick anymore. It was Herb's This 'n That Store. I'm only thirteen, and I can name three other businesses that used to own that store. First it was McCardle's Milk, which was cool because they had Pop Gums, a slime-green ice cream bar with bubble gum in the middle of it. Then it was Moishe's Meats, which pretty much put it off my map since when I was seven I was unlikely to want to browse in a butcher's store that had slabs of dead cows and featherless chickens in its window as if that would really draw people in. I think that'd be true even if I weren't a vegetarian. Then it was The Nickel House, which sold newspapers and comics and other things that cost a lot more than a nickel. They went out of business, maybe because you can't lie in your store's name and expect to get away with it for long. And then someone named Herb bought it and I guess gave up on trying to figure out what he would be selling, so it became the This 'n That Store, which was exactly what it was. But, throughout all this time, the old Pick-a-Chick sign stayed where it was, running the long way up the side of the brick building. By the time it got to Herb, the Pick-a-Chick sign was practically a local landmark. So, there the sign hung on the This 'n That store although chicken was one of the few things you absolutely couldn't get there. My parents hadn't exactly outlawed Herb's, but they weren't crazy about my going there since there was hardly anything in there that was Good For Me. Candy but no fruit. Comics but no books. Joke soap that turns your hands black but no ruled notebook paper. So, when I went, I tried to do it on the way to somewhere else so I could just sort of sidle on in.

"I didn't think about the ticket again until Tuesday night. After all, everyone knows that if you have a violin lesson on Monday, you don't have to practice until twenty-four hours later. Even parents understand this. It's practically a law. So, of course, I didn't open my violin case until Tuesday night. I had just finished my math homework and figured I'd get my violin practicing over with. This turned out to be lucky for me for two reasons. First, it meant that I opened up my case in my room, instead of in the den where I usually practice, so that when the lottery ticket fluttered out, no one saw it but me. Second, having just finished working on math problems put me in the right frame of mind. I had just been busting my brain on those problems where you have to figure out what the next number is by catching on to the pattern in the numbers before it. For example, if the series were 1,3,7,15 the next number would be 31 because between 1 and 3 is 2, and between 3 and 7 is 4, and between 7 and 15 is 8, so you keep multiplying the difference by two and adding it. And that turns out to be the same thing as multiplying by two and adding one. How almost interesting! So, when the lottery ticket floated off of my violin and fluttered down to the floor, for the first time I saw the number that the hat lady had picked. 35-8-27-9-18-9. Now, normally I have a real hard time with these types of problems, but this one I got right away, even though there was no reason to think there was anything to get. Maybe that's why I got it. Or maybe it was just that I noticed that the digits of the first number - 35 - added up to the second number. And, then, while I was at it, I noticed that if you subtract the second number from the first one - 35 minus 8 - you get the third number. And, wouldn't you know it, if you add the digits of the third number, you get the fourth.

"I was in the den, playing Commander Keen on the kids' computer. Keen's an old game, but it's a real time waster and because there's no blood and gore, my parents practically encourage me to play it. My mother was sitting at the roll-top desk, going over the bills, opening envelopes and shaking her head. And in comes my sister Maddie, holding the ticket, and saying, ""What's this?"" all innocently. Maddie, you have to understand, is five years old and enough to drive any brother insane. She's the worst variety of cute: the type that's cute and knows it. All she has to do is pull her little lower lip under her upper one and look at her shoes and shuffle her feet, and you can practically hear a crowd say ""Awww."" And then she gets what she wants. Not that there's anything really wrong with that. I'd do it too, if I could get away with it. But, Maddie seemed to me to be doing it more and more, as if recognizing that she was only about a birthday away from it not working for her anymore. You had to give her credit. She was milking it for all it was worth. I was out of my seat in a flash, thinking about how to explain how I ended up with the ticket when, to my amazement, my mother actually ignored Maddie. The telephone rang, and Mom was annoyed enough about being interrupted while working on the bills that she went for the phone to stop it from ringing as if it were a chipmunk she had to chase out of the house. So, while Mom was on the phone with someone trying to sell her another credit card - I pity the poor slob on the other end of the line - I was in Maddie's face and had grabbed the ticket from her. ""But what is it?"" she asked.. ""I'll tell you later. Now just keep quiet or I'll tell Mom you were playing with my violin again.""

"Life at Horace J. Oakes Middle School is far more complex than most people realize. It's a school where popularity counts more than just about anything. You could be the captain of the hockey team, a straight A student, great looking, and the star of this year's play - The Music Man, in case you were wondering - but if word got out that you were unpopular, well, you might as well find a cave with cable TV because you're not going to be doing a lot else with your time. Of course, if you were all those things, you'd probably be popular too. But that's the thing - it's only a probability. Popularity is one of those things that's hard to judge, like trying to decide if you're good looking by staring into a mirror. You just can't tell. You can tell if you're smart by looking at a report card (at least kind of), and you can tell if you're a good athlete by seeing how fast you run a race, but popularity is hard to measure. And it's also a little bit like being a celebrity who's famous just for being famous. Once word gets out that you're popular, well then, you're popular. But if you're popular and no one knows it, then you're not really popular. You can't say, ""I'm popular, although everyone disagrees,"" any more than you can say, ""I'm famous, but no one knows it."" Mind if I change the subject? I'm beginning to get a headache ... Anyway, the truth is that I could not claim to be one of the most popular kids in school. It's not that if you were to divide the school into two teams, The Populars and the Unpopulars, I would be made the captain of the Unpops.

"Friday was press day for my father. He publishes the local newspaper that comes out once a week. For the longest time I thought he hated it because whenever he talked about it, he was complaining: The local businesses weren't advertising, the ones who advertised weren't paying, the local residents weren't subscribing, the reporters weren't reporting. One complaint after another, sometimes for an entire dinner or Sunday morning walk. So, when I asked him a few years ago why he didn't quit, he looked shocked. ""Quit?? Jake, I love The Gaz. I wouldn't do anything else!"" (The Gaz was short for The Melville Gazette.) ""Why would you ask such a thing?"" When I told him that all I ever heard from him were complaints, you could see it sink in. After that, my father did a terrible job trying to be positive about The Gaz around me. It was cute. Fridays are tense days for my dad because that's the day the paper actually gets printed. It means he has to go to the printing plant to oversee the production. But it's also the last chance to discover and fix any last minute problems - and to find out that you made mistakes that now you can't fix because the paper's been printed. So, at dinner on Friday, when my mom asks how Dad's day was, it's not like the other days where you just expect a ""Fine"" that doesn't mean anything. On Friday, Dad's answer tells us what the mood of dinner and of the weekend will be like. Tonight, we got ""Well, it's done, anyway,"" which long years of listening to my father have taught me means: ""Rough day, but, in the end the newspaper turned out fine.""

My blankets were twisted around me as tightly as if elves had spent the evening practicing for their knot-tying merit badge. And when dawn finally came, I drifted off to sleep. To sleep, and to dream. To dream about coming home from school with dollar bills stuffed into every pocket and down my shirt and in my cap and in my lunch box. Dollar bills hanging out all over me. And my mother and father were waiting for me, asking me how my school day had been and if I'd like a snack, while I frantically kept shoving bills back into their hiding places, hoping my parents wouldn't see. It was nine thirty when I woke up, which was late for me on a Saturday morning. Even before breakfast, I made an excuse about getting some exercise, and hopped on my bike. The Pick-a-Chick was open. Outside was a stack of newspapers. I grabbed one and raced inside, pulling a dollar from my pants pocket. Mrs. Karchov was feeling particularly chatty that day, and it seemed forever before she gave me my fifty cents change.

His head hung down, his gaze intent upon the marker of his father's grave. He had visited the spot enough to have memorized every detail, so though his eyes looked there, they looked nowhere. Jack stood there and tried to make sense of it all. He was sure, absolutely sure, that this was the hardest thing he would ever have to do. The morning was clear, apart from a few clouds huddling around the sun for warmth. There was a bird delivering a morning sermon from a tree overhanging the edge of the cemetery. On days when the wind was right, Jack could hear the choir singing from the First Baptist Church three blocks over. Today was not one of those days, however, so he could not. Even if the wind had been right, Jack would not have listened, for he paid no attention to anything around him. Cars passed the cemetery, heading north toward Highway 15 and out of town, unnoticed. He reserved his attention strictly for his father. All the various aspects of Sunday for Jack were summarized in that place. It was the only church he ever attended, the only one he felt he needed. Taking a moment away from his reverie, he noticed the grass. It had begun to encroach upon the bronze plaque with its raised letters declaring his father's presence. He bent and began pulling up the shoots. The few intruders were ripped up by Jack's slow, thoughtful hands. He did not care for the cemetery, although it was not the purpose of the place which gave him pause. Being the son of a doctor had done something to prepare him for the inevitable. Jack disliked the cemetery because it seemed to have lost its significance. There was a kind of perennial dignity in the large headstones of old. Now, the newer sections of the cemetery had only plaques set in the ground.

"Jack worked all afternoon with the three lines of musical notation he had scribbled the day before, and was getting absolutely nowhere. Not necessarily nowhere, he corrected himself, those three lines have been perfected and re-perfected five times over. He had them memorized to the point where he could more than likely play them backwards. Have I eaten today? He looked at the clock on the wall. It was after five o'clock. He could not remember if he had even had breakfast, much less lunch. He turned his attention back to his sheet music. Its contents had been translated from the scrawl on his pad early this morning. Jack sighed. He put his hands to the keys and, with raised eyebrows, played the three lines backwards. In his frustration, he grimaced, struck the keys, and glanced over at Ted. Ted seemed to slump where he sat in the sunlight coming through the window. He looked as uninspired as Jack felt. ""You, too?"" Jack asked his plant, and did not get an answer. He had tried all day to coax some more music out of himself, but nothing would come. He would improvise another three or four lines beyond what he already had, and then stop, frozen with the knowledge that it was not working at all. He had changed tactics, trying to sneak up on the muse and ensnare it when it was not looking. He would go downstairs and watch some television, then come up and try again. Nothing. He had taken a long walk through the neighborhood, just to get his mind away from the page sitting at attention on his piano. Nothing. He could not go any further with what he had, he could not add to it, and he could not forget about it. Those next phrases were there somewhere, and he felt-- There was a knock at the door.

We knew this town had really nothing to offer us, for one thing, and we had to get out as soon as possible or this hellhole would swallow us completely. We all wanted to do something with our lives that just didn't fit with the small town mentality. And I know, this isn't supposed to be the typical small town. I hear there's a couple of places called ""research parks"" now that have a lot of really great, fast-moving corporations that provide a lot of needed dollars, where you can go and get a job that will take you just as far as the company wants you to go. But go ahead and preach to me about how great this town is and how free-thinking and progressive and so forth and then trot over to the community college, and see how many liberal arts classes they offer. I'll bet it's not much compared to the engineering classes. I remember what it was like living here, and it doesn't take but a few days back here to remind you that it was a good idea to leave in the first place. Anyway, I'm getting off on a tangent here.

He'd sing along with the radio, he'd sing along with the television, hell, he'd make shit up and sing it if there wasn't anything else to sing. He wrote lyrics, good ones too, but his voice wasn't for shit. He was always either writing lyrics or poetry, or turning one into the other. He was quite a character.

"Jack was downstairs, fixing breakfast. There were two things in life Jack had found he could do exceptionally well. The first, of course, was music. His piano helped keep him sane, and there were times during the last six months when Jack was positive it was the one thing keeping him from throwing himself from a bridge. The second thing was cooking. After the death of his father, he had learned quickly that if he wanted to eat anything that did not come in a box with the designation ""Microwaveable"" on it, he had better learn to make it himself. Debra never lifted a finger, unless it was to write a check for the pizza delivery boy. She preferred fast food, or anything that could be thrown quickly across a counter. The person in question sat at the table, looking up periodically at Jack, and then back down at the Universal Tribune. He heard Campbell on the stairs, and turned around. ""Good morning,"" he said, as Campbell entered the kitchen. Campbell glanced for a moment at Debra, and then at Jack. ""Christ, Jack,"" he said, eyes widening, ""what the hell are you doing?"" Jack had eggs working on one of the stove's eyes, french toast on another, and yet another with sausage and bacon. He had a spatula in either hand. ""Hungry?"" he asked Campbell. ""I hope I am,"" he replied, raising an eyebrow. ""I didn't know what you liked,"" Jack turned back to the stove with a shrug. ""Sorry."" Over breakfast, they talked about what to do that day. Fearing for their privacy, they packed the feast Jack prepared onto two trays, and took it to his room. Campbell did most of the talking, relating what had led him to search for Carol in the first place: his desire to discover what had become of his childhood companions.

"On Thursday at eight forty-five, Jack found himself standing outside Ray's Diner. A trio of men walked out of the diner talking and laughing. ""What am I doing here?"" he mumbled under his breath. The question was meant to be rhetorical, but an answer came to him anyway. He remembered how it had felt, standing there, holding Karen's hand. He recalled how soft it had seemed, how that simple action managed to lift his spirits to a level he had forgotten existed. He knew he would have been content to spend the rest of the day holding her hand, his skin touching hers, because it reminded him of how pleasant and simple his life used to be. Thinking back, he could almost picture a time when the feeling had been commonplace and perhaps even taken for granted. I want that back, he thought, as much of it as I can, if it's not entirely out of my reach. Another thought struck him, and it was the rock upon which he built up his courage. And I'm not going to get any happier standing out here waiting for something to happen, so -- But something did happen. The lights began to go out in the diner, one by one, as if on cue. Before Jack realized he meant to do so, he was sprinting up the stairs to the front door. Karen's face was in the window, looking back at him. His rapid ascent to the doorway appeared to have startled her for a moment, but upon recognizing him her expression changed to one of surprised delight. She held up one finger, asking him to wait for a moment, and then she finished turning out the lights. She unlocked the door and stepped out into the night air, which was cooler than usual for summer. ""So you decided to come by,"" she said, as she turned her back on him and locked the front door. ""I was worried you had forgotten.""

"Campbell arrived home around six o'clock, and fixed himself something to eat. He took it upstairs and found Jack finishing his preparations. ""Looking good,"" Campbell said, as he took a bite out of his sandwich. ""Looking very good indeed."" Jack had chosen a pair of blue jeans, along with a white T-shirt. Over the shirt was a dark blue button-down, completely open down the front and untucked, with the sleeves rolled up. He was putting on his shoes as Campbell spoke. ""So, son,"" Campbell continued, deepening his voice, ""need to borrow the car?"" ""No, thanks,"" Jack said, fixing his hair in the mirror. ""Everything planned tonight is within walking distance."" He turned to face Campbell. ""Small town ambiance."" Campbell chewed thoughtfully, swallowed. ""Tell me again why you don't have a car?"" ""I told you, I do have one. It's in the garage."" Campbell was surprised. ""Why don't you ever use it?"" ""It was a gift from my father -- in the will, I mean."" Jack's voice grew suddenly quiet, almost reverent. ""It's not the newest thing under the sun, anyway. Good shape, though. He left plenty of money for her to buy whatever she needed,"" he nodded his head towards the kitchen, where the television was on, ""including another car, but I've never wanted to use it. She uses it whenever she wants, because I don't want to. Memories, I guess."" ""Sorry,"" Campbell said, ""I didn't mean to get you all upset before your date."" ""Don't worry about it,"" Jack told him. ""Nothing can get me depressed right now."" He brightened a little, and smiled. ""Anyone who gets depressed on a first date with a positively wonderful young lady needs to have his head examined."" ""Good point,"" Campbell said. ""Besides, walking everywhere gives her plenty of time to talk.""

"Tall. Dark hair. Nose almost straight. Mouth curving around prominent teeth. Beautiful, Oliver realized as their eyes met perfectly. ""Francesca, sorry I'm late,"" another woman said, guiding two girls into the next booth. ""I just got here."" ""Hi, Mommy."" Francesca's smile turned down, traveled around, and turned up independently at each corner. ""Hi, Sweetheart. Turn around, now."" One of the girls was looking tentatively at Oliver, holding the top of the booth with both hands. He waved at her, raised his eyebrows, and bent to his eggs. Toast. Nothing like toast. He wiped up the remaining yolk. Where's the husband? Probably one of those jerks in a Land Rover. A bad golfer. Cheats. Christ. Oliver drank the rest of his coffee and prepared to leave. As he slid sideways across the green plastic seat, he again caught the woman's eyes. They were calm and questioning, brown with deepening centers the color of the inner heart of black walnut. He stood and nodded in the Japanese manner. No one would have noticed, unless perhaps for her friend. He buttoned his coat before pushing open the outer door of the diner. The air was damp, tinged with car exhaust and diesel. The first flakes of a northeaster coasted innocently to the ground. Francesca--what a smile! She reminded him of the young Sinatra in _From Here To Eternity_, awkward and graceful at the same time. The friend was heavier and looked unmarried, a career teacher, maybe. Problems on short leashes yapped around her heels. Oliver shrugged, pulled a watch cap over his ears, and walked toward the Old Port. A car pulled over. ""Olive Oil!"" George Goodbean shouted. ""Want a ride?"" ""Taking my life in my hands,"" Oliver said, getting in. ""It's a good day to die,"" George said. ""Aren't we romantic."" ""Artists live on the edge, Olive Oil. Where the view is."" A pickup passed at high speed, hitting a pothole and splattering mud across the windshield. ""Moron!"" George reached for the wiper switch.

"Oliver worked on the mailing list all week. He tried not to think about Jacky, although she came into his mind regularly, especially at night. Her big eyes held him before he fell asleep; her body was just out of reach. When he wasn't sitting in front of the computer, he worked on the walnut box. He finished the dovetails. Fitting the bottom of the box was a puzzle. He had cut it to rest inside; it had to be supported just above the low bottom arches. He didn't want to put screws through the sides of the box, and if he put supporting ledger strips on the inside, the bottom would be raised too high. He fastened a small block to the lower inside of each corner. The blocks strengthened the feet of the box and supported the bottom just above the arches. He was satisfied with that solution, but when he pushed the bottom down on the blocks it did not fit perfectly flush against all four sides. The cracks bothered him. By Friday, after much experimenting, he had made tiny moldings to cover the cracks. ""Thank God for routers,"" he said to Jennifer Lindenthwaite. ""Took me about five tries, but I did it."" ""I wish Rupert had your talent,"" she sighed. ""It's not talent; it's pig-headedness."" ""Pigs are sweet, really,"" Jennifer said. ""They get a bad rap."" She stood. ""Let's see the program."" She liked what he'd done and asked him whether Jacky had approved it. ""Jacky said that, as long as I included everything that she wanted, you should be the judge--since you would have to use it and train others to use it."" ""It looks good to me,"" Jennifer said. ""I'll have Mary mail you a check on Tuesday. We pay bills on Tuesdays."" ""Thanks.""

"Jacky's transfer left a hole in Oliver's life. He tried to explain it to Mark Barnes without getting into details. ""I mean, we were going in different directions anyway. She wanted a lot . . ."" ""Yeah."" Mark laughed. ""How it goes."" ""But I got used to seeing her. She has a house in South Portland. I used to go over there sometimes on weekends--nice place, garden out back, blueberries, the high bush kind. I pruned them. We'd have a glass of wine, get into it . . . Now, nothing. And the hell of it is: I don't feel like seeing anyone else."" ""Used to take me 18 months to get over a relationship,"" Mark said. ""Now it's 18 weeks and dropping. You know what they say about falling off a horse."" ""Climb back on--right."" Oliver said. ""All very well for you. I'm not, like, in demand. I got lucky, was all."" ""Come on! Just cuz you're four feet, two . . ."" ""Five feet, two,"" Oliver said. ""Don't you forget it."" ""Ork. It doesn't mean shit,"" Mark said. ""Do I look like Mr. Studley?"" ""How do you do it, anyway?"" ""Fabric, man. They're helpless for fabric. You got to buy stuff they want to touch. The ladies have no imagination; if they can't touch it, it doesn't count."" Mark drank and smiled. ""I spend a fortune on shirts and sweaters. 'Oooh,' they say. I hold out my arm for the feel. 'Yeah, nice--silk and cashmere,' I say. 'Alpaca,' or whatever the hell it is. Next day, I mail it to them. Would look better on you, I tell them."" ""I don't have a fortune,"" Oliver said. ""Shop around,"" Mark said. ""Linen. You got to start somewhere."" ""Yeah,"" Oliver said. For the hell of it, he checked out Filene's Basement, but he couldn't find anything that didn't have the executive leisurewear look. The next day he was in Freeport and stopped at the Ralph Lauren factory outlet store. He bought a linen bush jacket that was radically marked down. It was dyed a dark sandy color and looked as though it would last.

"If Francesca weren't married, Oliver would have been after her in an instant. He didn't know what to do. He couldn't think of a way to give her the box and the valentine without putting her in an awkward position. He placed them on the mantelpiece in the living room. The walnut and the bronze gave him a warm feeling; they signalled a future or at least a connection with her. He might have hustled a programming project, but the thought of business meetings sent him across the bridge to Crescent Beach. The air was fresh and salty, softened by the waxy smell of beach roses. Children played. Dogs chased Frisbees. Waves curled and crashed along the sand. In September, in Maine, time has a way of crystallizing and standing still. Oliver soaked up the sunny shortening days. He was rested and tan, increasingly coiled for some kind of action. He received a postcard from Jacky saying that she was living in a motel but was about to move into a house. Her job was a lot of work but going well. She missed him. He sent a housewarming card to the new address and said that he missed her, too. No harm in that. Besides, it was true. One afternoon in October, when the leaves were beginning to change color, he came home and heard Jacky's voice on the answering machine. ""Oliver, are you there? No? I'm in town. I'm staying at the Regency. I'm wondering if you would join me for dinner. I've got a meeting in ten minutes. Just come to the restaurant in the hotel, if you can, at six."" There was a short pause. ""I'll understand if you can't make it. I know it's short notice. Bye."" Her voice softened on the ""bye,"" and she hung up. Oliver paced a couple of tight circles and decided to go. He did his laundry and ironed a white linen shirt. At six, he walked into the Regency and said to the hostess, ""I'm meeting someone . . ."" He looked around for Jacky.

"Traffic was moderate. Oliver hummed along, enjoying the oranges, reds, and yellows of New England in October. He crossed the Hudson on the Tappan Zee Bridge, bypassing New York, glad to be moving again after weeks of inaction. His money and what felt like his entire future was in his pocket. At five o'clock he cruised slowly through Atlantic City. He found Bally's, parked, and went to his room. He washed his face, changed into his outfit, and went back outside. The boardwalk stretched out of sight along the beach. It was warmer and more humid than in Maine. Lazy waves collapsed on the sand. Beach-goers and gamblers of all ages strolled back and forth--studs with oiled glistening muscles, grandmothers with straw hats and outrageous sunglasses, Afro-Americans, Latinos, Asians. He was too warm in his suit. He returned to the air conditioned hotel and entered the casino. Loud music. Hellish reds and blacks. The women that Jacky had remembered were seated in front of rows of flashing slot machines. The women pulled long levers mechanically; win or lose, they pulled again. Bells rang as an occasional jackpot cascaded from a machine. Oliver recognized the crap tables--elongated mahogany figure eights, surrounded by players leaning over the action. Dice rolled, bounced, and tumbled to a stop on the gleaming green felt. People cheered or groaned. The roulette wheels were in a different section. The blackjack dealers were beyond the roulette wheels. At the far end of the casino, behind bars, cashiers exchanged chips for money or vice versa. Cashing in your chips, for real, Oliver thought. He pushed $1000 toward a cashier. ""What do you want?"" Oliver hesitated. ""Hundreds, twenties, tens, fives, what?"" ""Give me one hundred dollar chip,"" Oliver said, ""the rest, tens and fives."" ""You want to leave some in the cage?"" ""Five hundred,"" Oliver said. The cashier issued him a plastic card with a magnetic strip. ""Give this to the pit boss when you want more."" ""I got these complimentary dollars,"" Oliver said, ""when I checked in."" ""Over there."" The cashier pointed to a barred room within the main room. ""Promotions."" Oliver walked over to Promotions.

"Oliver drove a mile and stopped, ears buzzing from wine and the violent emotion. He saw Jacky again, sitting up on the bed, one hand across her heart, and he felt a stab of pain and longing. It wasn't too late to turn around. They could put the pieces back together; he could serve her, and she would take care of him. Why not? What else was he going to do? He searched around in the glove compartment and found a Willy Nelson tape. Might as well have the real thing. _On the road again . . ._ Shit. He pounded the steering wheel once and kept going. Philadelphia. He made it past the city and began to wear down. He didn't need to hurry--Arlen wasn't expecting him home for a couple of days. He turned off the highway and stopped at a motel. He put his bag on a chair and lay down for a moment. Had he done the right thing? Or was he just running away from commitment? He was in a bind. He couldn't stay in a submissive relationship with Jacky, but the more powerful that he felt as an individual, the lonelier he became and the more he wanted her--or someone. Pie. At least there was pie. Somewhere. He drove down the road until he came to a diner. Two state cops were drinking coffee at one end of the counter. A truck driver and three construction workers sat at the other end. Oliver sat between the two groups and sank further into his feelings. Thirty-five and what did he have to show for it? Six thousand dollars and a cat. An old Jeep. He finished his apple pie and watched the double doors to the kitchen swing shut behind the waitress. The swinging doors dissolved into dark water. He saw Owl overboard, holding his head above the waves. ""Find your father,"" Owl said. Oliver's eyes opened wide. Owl had said that once. ""Someday, you should find your father."" Oliver thought hard. He had to do something. It was good advice. He made up his mind to try. ""More coffee?"" ""Uh--yes. Please.""

"I walked everywhere in those days. I had a car but I couldn't always afford gas. Sometimes, at night, I went up to the windows of houses and looked inside. In the dark, you can stand right on the other side of the glass, and no one ever knows you're there. From the street, these places always seem like the kind of homes you see in magazine ads, all red walls and leather furniture. Close up, though, it's mostly just people watching television or doing the dishes. Although once I saw a woman feeding soup to a man with two broken legs. There was nothing wrong with his arms but she fed him soup anyway, kneeling beside him on the couch and carefully lifting the spoon to his lips. Another time I saw a man putting on eyeliner. I was standing deep in a driveway between houses and looking into a bedroom. I could see him through the cracks between the blinds. He was sitting at a vanity with lights around the mirror. When he was done with the eyeliner he put on eye shadow and lipstick. Then he cleaned his face with a tissue and blew himself a kiss. After that, he walked out of the room and didn't come back. I wondered whose makeup it was. His wife's? His roommate's? And once I came across another man doing the same thing as me. I started down a driveway and saw him kneeling on the ground at the other end, his face shining from the light of the basement window in front of him. He never looked away from it, not even when I went back up the driveway. I don't think he ever knew I was there. I never went back to that house again. I was twenty-three or twenty-four at the time, I can't really remember anymore. I hadn't worked in months. My wife had left me. Sometimes I woke up with shooting pains in my stomach, like someone had stabbed me while I slept. The doctors said there was nothing wrong with me.

"On one of these walks I met a blind man. It was around five or six in the evening. I could tell he was blind by the fact that he wore those dark glasses and he was tapping around the base of a telephone pole with a long, white cane. When I tried to walk around him, he swung the cane into my legs. It bent like it was made of rubber. I had to stop because he kept the cane in front of me. I couldn't move without jumping over it. ""I'm a little lost,"" he said, as if I'd asked him how he was. ""There's not a newspaper box around here, is there?"" ""No, there's nothing but the telephone pole,"" I told him. ""There's supposed to be a newspaper box,"" he said, ""but I guess my counting got thrown off somewhere."" ""Yes, that's most likely it,"" I agreed, even though I didn't really know what he was talking about. I waited for him to move the cane but he didn't. ""I was walking to the school,"" he went on. ""But I should have come across it by now. You don't see a school anywhere, do you?"" I looked around. We were standing in front of an old Victorian house with vines growing up the front of it. A young girl in white pajamas stood in the front window, watching us. There weren't any lights on behind her. She was just a white silhouette against the darkness. I wondered where her parents were. ""No,"" I said, ""there's nothing but houses around here."" ""Wow,"" he said, shaking his head. ""I'm really messed up."" The girl didn't move at all, didn't even seem to blink. She looked like a ghost, and for some reason, that thought reminded me of the last night I ever saw my wife. ""I could really use some help here,"" the blind man said.

"The blind man kept his free hand on my arm while we walked, as if he was afraid I would run away if he didn't. All the way down the street, he tapped the ground in front of us with his cane and counted under his breath. Now that I was taking him back the way he had come, he seemed to know exactly where we were at all times. Every intersection we took, he guided me in a different direction. Soon I was the one who was lost. ""I have it all memorized,"" he told me as we went along. ""I go for the same walk, to the school and back, every night. Turn left out the door, two hundred and twenty steps to the first right, four hundred and ten from there..."" He went on like that for some time and then ended with, ""And that box has always been there before, a hundred steps from the intersection, give or take, after the second left turn. Always. I don't understand it."" ""How do you know when you're actually at the school?"" I wanted to know. ""I mean, even if you take the proper amount of steps, how do you know it's the school and not something else, like a bank or a high-rise?"" I pictured him tapping his way around a building, trying to figure out what it was just by its size and shape. Maybe counting taps like he did steps. ""I can hear the kids,"" he told me. ""There are always kids in the playground, even in the middle of the night. It's like they don't know where else to go."" Later, he said, ""You're probably wondering why I go to the school every day."" ""No, not really."" ""I'm not after any Lolitas, if you know what I mean."" ""No, I don't.""

"Sometimes the people from the modeling studio upstairs used the room for shoots. It would always be one man - the photographer - and a group of women. They'd come in and get the key from whatever waitress was working and lock themselves in there. Sometimes they wouldn't come out for hours. I imagined them having sex in there, on the couches or maybe on piles of the clothes they brought in with them, like a scene out of some movie. One night I helped with a shoot. A photographer came in with three models from upstairs. None of the women looked over eighteen, but one of them paid for a round of drinks with a gold card. They sat at the booth underneath the Hepburn poster and smoked cigars all night long. They were sitting in the No Smoking section, but the waitress working that night - a new woman I didn't know, who charged me full price for the drinks - never said anything to them. Around midnight, the photographer came over to the bar, where I'd been sitting all night. ""You work here?"" he asked. I looked around for the waitress, but she was nowhere in sight. ""Yeah,"" I said. ""I work here."" ""We're ready for the back room now,"" he said. I wasn't exactly sure what he meant, but I went around the counter and got the key anyway. When I opened the door, the models all wandered into the room and sat down on the furniture there. Each of them carried a couple of garment bags that they dropped to the floor once they were inside. ""I could use a glass of water,"" one of them said. She held her foot up to look at her toenails. I went back to the bar and poured some water into a glass, threw a lemon slice from a bowl into it, and brought it to her. She took it without saying thanks or even looking at me.

"I met the coma woman at Kennedy's place. I went there to talk to him about a job, but he was throwing a party when I drove up. People were staggering out of his yard and falling down in the street. I drove around them and parked a dozen houses up, then walked back, holding my jacket over my head to protect myself from the rain. Two weeks of it had turned all the lawns into swamps and still it came down, filling the air like static. At the end of Kennedy's driveway, two women were trying to lift a man who was lying face down in the street, his head half-submerged in the overflow from a storm drain. ""He's going to drown,"" one of the women kept saying, but the other was laughing so hard they couldn't even get his face out of the water. Kennedy was sitting on the swing set in the front yard, smoking a joint with a woman who held an umbrella above them. For some reason he was wearing a housecoat over his jeans and T-shirt. ""Hey, glad you could make it,"" he said and offered me the joint. He kept holding it out to me even after I shook my head. ""I didn't know you were having a party,"" I said. ""It's to celebrate my new job,"" he said. ""You didn't invite me,"" I said. ""I didn't?"" ""Wyman told me you had a line on a job. I came here to talk to you about that.

Beside him, the woman reached out and took the joint from his hand, then disappeared under the umbrella. The rain was starting to seep through my jacket, which I was still holding over my head.
